# **Three R Examples About My Work**

I work as a purchasing manager at Arcelik. My duty as a purchasing engineer is to manage supplier quotas, find the best suppliers and follow the manufacturing processes of suppliers. Arcelik buys millions of parts from suppliers and a little mistake by a supplier can cost a lot for the company. I have to monitor suppliers' statistics and decide if fwe want to work with a supplier or not. 

Also we store all past price data to see how much prices change and how they are affected by different events. We also monitor our own performance statistic so we use a programm written by Arcelik to store our own performance data.

## **Example 1**

By using R I can manage data about my suppliers. Since we manufacture a lot of different machine parts we have a lot of suppliers. Therefor it is very difficult to manage all data about suppliers like how many parts they manufacture and material codes of those parts.

## **Example 2**

I can also manage historical data about myself since our company also wants to see statics about ourselves at the end of the year like how much money I managed last year and how we distributed it between suppliers and how much it increased since last year.

## **Example 3** 

Making improvements about manufacturing processes is an important part of my job. I can store and manage technical information about processes like process time and material usage which makes it easier to visualize improvements and how much impact it makes on costs.
